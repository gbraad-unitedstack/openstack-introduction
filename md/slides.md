## What is OpenStack

  * Many definitions
    * project
    * foundation
    * set of applications
    * deployed environment


## OpenStack Mission

  * Produce the ubiquitous
    _Open Source Cloud Computing_ platform
  * easy to use, simple to implement
  * works well at all scales
  * interoperable
  * meet the needs
    * users, operators
    * public, private clouds


## OpenStack Foundation

  * An independent body providing shared resources
  * Helps to achieve the _OpenStack Mission_
    * Protecting
    * Empowering
    * Promoting

  * OpenStack software and the community around it
    * users
    * developers
    * entire ecosystem


## Understand OpenStack as a community

  * Foundation mission
    * core values
    * target 

  * Definition of 'open' / openness
    * source
    * community
    * design
    * development


## Customer as target audience

  * enterprise need
  * consultant listens
  * task of the engineer

Bridge gap between community


## Microservices

  * a set of applications
  * unix philosophy
    * do one thing
    * and do it well
  * communication


## Architecture

## OpenStack components

  * Core services
    * KeyStone
    * Nova
    * Neutron
    * Glance
    * Cinder


## KeyStone

  * [Keystone](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/) provides Identity, Token, Catalog and Policy services


## Overview

![img]()


## Nova

  * [Nova](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/) provides power massively scalable, on demand, self service access to compute resources


## Cinder

  * [Cinder](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/cinder/) provides “block storage as a service”


## Glance

  * [Glance](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/glance/) provides a service where users can upload and discover data assets that are meant to be used with other services


## Neutron

  * [Neutron](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/neutron/) provides “network connectivity as a service” between interface devices (e.g., vNICs)


## Horizon

  * [Horizon](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/horizon/) is the canonical implementation of OpenStack’s Dashboard


## Swift

  * [Swift](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/) is a highly available, distributed, eventually consistent object/blob store
