## MISSION
To produce a ubiquitous Open Source Cloud Computing platform that is easy to use, simple to implement, interoperable between deployments, works well at all scales, and meets the needs of users and operators of both public and private clouds.


## DON'T DEPLOY THE WORLD
JUST THE MINIMUM AND YOUR USE-CASE.

## SAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS
Think of these as curated playlists of OpenStack configurations. These sample configurations are based on OpenStack case studies and real-world reference architectures across industries and workloads. Each configuration will give you a good idea of which core and optional projects can be used for different environments.


##  Big tent is not that big of a deal.
We only care about the projects that apply to our use cases, plus the minimum.

We know how to navigate through projects to evaluate them.


##  As an application developer,
   I want to deploy and run an application on the internet so that my customers all over the world can consume it.


##  As an operator,
I want to deploy the application across multiple clouds so that my service survives issues in any one of them.


##  As a compliance officer,
I want to deploy and run an application in a location of my choosing so that I can comply with regulatory demands.











## Projects

  * [Aodh](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/aodh/), provides alarms and notifications based on metrics
  * [Bifrost](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/bifrost/), automates the task of deploying a base image on baremetal using Ironic
